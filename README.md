tools for working with snowpit data and other instruments
Steps:
1) use pitsheet.xls to enter your pit data.  Note it must stay as an Excel 95 file
2) use load_pitdata.m to load the xls file above
3) use PlotSnowpitProfile5.m to plot the snowpit
4) see examples:
plotBrundageDec24pit.m = example with SMP data
plotTrailCreekPit.m = example with NIR data and wetness
plotGMpit.m = example with seismic inversion and SMP
